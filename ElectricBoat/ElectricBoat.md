# Electric Powered Boat Project

In the summer of 2016, a team of fellow engineers and I worked on building a manned, electric powered boat. The boat was designed, fabricated and driven by our team, under the super vision of staff members working at the [MIT-IDC](https://innovation.mit.edu/resource/international-design-center/). In designing the boat, we utilized software such as [SolidWorks](https://www.solidworks.com/) and [Rhinoceros](https://www.rhino3d.com/) as 3D modelling tools, which we could then use as engineering references for fabrication. I was tasked with building the mechanical drivetrain, which along with the streamline design of the boat, propelled us to number 1 in a little race amongst other boat builders.

## The Electric Boat

The design and build processes were tiring but extremely enjoyable, lasting a duration of approximately 8 weeks. However, we finally succeeded in finishing its construction, where it very smoothly rode the gentle waves of the Charles river in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

## Team Cougar

The team, which dawned the
name "Cougar", consisted of 6 individuals (in photo below), all of whom were rising sophomores at the time.
