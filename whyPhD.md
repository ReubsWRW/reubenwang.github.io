# Why do a PhD?

I think very early on as an undergraduate, it was blindingly apparent to me that I wanted to do physics for the rest of my life. Just as music theory and exposure fosters a muscian's deep appreciation for melodious compositions, so has physics unveiled the elegance and beauty of the world around me. To me, physics at its core is such a pure pursuit to uncovering the inner workings of our percieved reality. Yet despite its almost simplistic goal, the journey to attaining such an understanding is unfathomably difficult. This poses a magnificent challenge to us all, and has unequivocally entranced my curiosities. To put in colloquial terms, where does the rabbit hole end? What underlies "the matrix"? In the off chance that human creativity, ingenuity and persistence really can answer these questions, I want nothing else but to have been part of the ragtag band of dreamers who tried.

With this view, a PhD was quite clearly the appropriate program to elevate my faculties and prepare me for significant contributions to the field. Moreover, the environment and people you surround yourself with play a major role in your personal growth and mentality. It was only natural then, that I wanted to be around other physics enthusiasts and experts, to cultivate my mind for the many unprecendented intellectual curve balls physics might throw at me. A PhD program also nicely formalizes many of the oherwise turbulent paths one could take in trying to establish a career in physics. This is no doubt a nice thing to have when the subject matter itself presents a vast amount of chaos (quite literally). Alongside grounding me in the existing literature and uncovering new physics, I think a PhD also opens the opportunity for me to impart the knowledge I have acquired from my teachers to future generations. Just as is the subject, so too is teaching it an art in and of itself. Teaching is a skill that I want to hone. Just as I have been inspired by many of my instructors, so too do I want the chance to nurture a passion and curiosity for phyiscs in others. 

A large appeal of a PhD was also the prospect of ownership and agency over my work. Before continuing, I'd like to remark that I use the term "work" for the sole reason that I get paid to do it. I am truly fortunate to be able to earn a living doing a great passion of mine. Now back to our regularly scheduled program, I believe that a big part of feeling fulfilled at the workplace comes from the ability say what you're working on is truly "your baby". Even as a graduate student, my experience has been that although there is a general research direction set by my advisor (which is much needed as a young, naive researcher), there is a lot of freedom to chase down the scientific leads I want to investigate. There has been overhelming support for me to voice my ideas and engage in stimulating conversations that have been invaluable to the research I do. Perhaps this is a product of the amazing atmosphere established by the people at JILA, but this has always been what research is about to me. I see a PhD as more than just a stepping stone, but a time in my life to find myself as a physicist, a person in society and hopefully as a positive ripple in spacetime.

I'd like to thank my research advisors in the past, [Prof Dario Poletti](https://people.sutd.edu.sg/~dario_poletti/), [Prof Cheah Chin Wei](https://epd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/cheah-chin-wei) and [Prof Riccardo Comin](http://scattering.mit.edu/) for all their guidance and support that led me to the PhD position I have today.
