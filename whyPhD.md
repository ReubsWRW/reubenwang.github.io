# Why do a PhD?

I think very early on in my undergraduate life, it was blindingly apparent to me that I wanted to do physics for the rest of my life. Just as music theory and exposure fosters a muscian's deep appreciation for melodious compositions, so has physics unveiled the elegance and beauty of the world around me. To me, physics at its core is such a pure pursuit in uncovering the inner workings of the reality we percieve. Yet despite its almost simplistic goal, the journey to attaining that long sought after "theory of everything" is just unfathomably difficult. This poses a magnificent challenge to us all, and has unequivocally entranced my curiosities. To put 
in colloquial terms, where does the rabbit hole end? What underlies "the matrix"? In the off chance that human creativity, ingenuity and persistence really can answer these questions, I want nothing else but to have been 
a part of the ragtag band of dreamers who tried.

With this view, a PhD is quite clearly the appropriate program to elevate my faculties and prepare me to be a
significant contributor to the field. Moreover, it is clear that the environment and people you surround 
yourself with play a major role in your personal growth and mentality. It is only then natural that I want to be 
around other physics enthusiasts and experts, to cultivate my mind for the many unprecendented intellectual 
curve balls physics might throw at me. A PhD program also nicely formalizes many of the oherwise turbulent 
paths one could take in trying to establish a career in physics. This is no doubt a nice thing to have when the 
subject matter itself presents a vast amount of chaos (quite literally). Alongside grounding me in the existing 
literature and uncovering new physics, I think a PhD opens the opportunity for me to impart the knowledge I have 
acquired from my teachers to future generations. Just as is the subject, so too is teaching it an art in and of 
itself. Teaching is a skill that I want to hone. Just as I have been inspired by many of my instructors, 
so too do I want the chance to nurture a passion and curiosity for phyiscs in others. 

A large appeal of a PhD was also the prospect of ownership and agency over the work I get to do. Before I 
continue, I'd like to remark that I use the term "work" for the sole reason that I get paid to do it. 
I am truly fortunate to be able to earn a living doing a great passion of mine. Now back to our regularly 
scheduled program, I believe that a big part of feeling fulfilled at the workplace comes from the 
ability say what you're working on is truly "your baby". Even as a graduate student, my experience has been that 
although there is a general research direction set by your advisor (which is much needed as a young, naive 
researcher), there is a lot of freedom to chase down the scientific leads I want to investigate. There has been 
overhelming support for me to voice my ideas and engage in stimulating conversations that have been invaluable
to the research I do. Perhaps this is a product of the amazing atmosphere established by the people at JILA, but
this has always been what research is about to me. I see a PhD as more than just a stepping stone, but a time
in my life to find myself as a physicist, a person in society and hopefully as a positive ripple in spacetime.

I'd like to thank my research advisors in the past, Prof Dario Poletti, Prof Cheah Chin Wei and Prof Riccardo 
Comin for all their guidance and support that led me to the PhD position I have today.
