# The Quantum World

Here is a catalog of the notes and slides I made and used to conduct a workshop on quantum mechanics and quantum computation at SUTD. The workshop was targeted at engineering students with no prior knowledge of quantum theory and designed to be brief but rigorous. The workshop spanned 4, 2 hour long sessions, for which not all material in the notes was covered.
