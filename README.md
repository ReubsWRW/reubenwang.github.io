I was born and raised in the tropical island of [Singapore](https://www.visitsingapore.com/en/). My formal academic pursuits have been in STEM, where I studied engineering (at [SUTD](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/)) and physics (at [MIT](http://www.mit.edu/)) as an undergraduate. I am now doing my doctorate in theoretical physics at [JILA](https://jila.colorado.edu/), a joint institute between [CU, Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/) and [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/) ([Curriculum Vitae](./CV2022.pdf)).

[Here's](./whyPhD.md) a little write up of why a PhD for those interested.

# Physics Research

I am currently working in the [Bohn group](http://grizzly.colorado.edu/) at [JILA](https://jila.colorado.edu/). My area of research falls under the field of *atomic, molecular and optical* (**AMO**) physics, particularly studying *many-body physics* and the *thermodynamics of ultracold gases* (i.e. I like to study the behavior of systems with many things when they are very cold). Below is a (hopefully growing) list of my publications. Enjoy! 

## Publications

My *Google scholar* can be found [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Lsw_2DgAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1)!

* [R. R. W. Wang and J. L. Bohn, **"Thermal Conductivity of an Ultracold Paramagnetic Bose Gas"**, submitted to Physical Review A (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10465) <br />
**DIGEST:**
*Fluid mechanics studies macroscopic phenomena by means of coarse graining over all the microscopic particles which actually make up the fluid. However, certain properties of the fluid do require a deep understanding of the microscopic underpinnings from which they arise. One such property is the thermal conductivity, which measures the rate at which heat spreads throughout the fluid. In this work, we study a fluid made up of highly magnetic atoms that results in thermal conduction that varies with the direction relative to the atomic-magnetic orientation. This opens up opportunities to steer the flow of heat through these fluids, by changing the atomic-magnetic orientations with applied magnetic fields. *

* [A. Patscheider, L. Chomaz, G. Natale, D. Petter, M. J. Mark, S. Baier, B. Yang, R. R. W. Wang, J. L. Bohn, F. Ferlaino, **"Accurate determination of the scattering length of erbium atoms"**, submitted to Physical Review A (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11883) <br />
**DIGEST:**
*At extremely cold temperatures, atoms interact with each other quantum mechanically, quantified by a property known as the scattering length (analogous to the diameter of colliding billiard balls). Magnetic fields can be applied to change the scattering length, permitting a tuning knob for varying atomic interactions. This work presents precise experimental measurements of the scattering length for Erbium atoms, over a broad range of magnetic fields. These were extracted by careful comparisons of experimental data to our theoretical model.*

* [R. R. W. Wang and J. L. Bohn, **"Anisotropic thermalization of dilute dipolar gases"**, Physical Review A (2021).](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.103.063320) <br />
**DIGEST:**
*Just as the temperature of a room eventually evenly rises with the sudden introduction of heat, so too is the same for an isolated gas of ultracold atoms. The route to this new equilibrium temperature, is however highly dependent on the properties of the individual atoms. In this work, we derive concise formulas for how strong magnetism in atoms can affect the route to which gases reach their equilibrium temperature. These formulas will thus allow experimentalist to determine magnetic properties in atoms, simply by temperature measurements alone.*

* [J. Li, W. G. Tobias, K. Matsuda, C. Miller, G. Valtolina, L. De Marco, R. R. W. Wang, L. Lassablière, G. Quéméner, J. L. Bohn and J. Ye, **"Tuning of dipolar interactions and evaporative cooling in a three-dimensional molecular quantum gas"**, Nature Physics (2021).](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-021-01329-6) <br />
**DIGEST:**
*Molecules have highly complex internal structures, making them extremely hard to control. In particular, gaseous molecules tend to chemically react as they bump against each other, disallowing the gas from cooling down through evaporation (like how a cup of coffee cools with its lid off).  This work demonstrates the experimental ability to shield Potassium-Rubidium (KRb) molecules from chemically reacting, using an incredibly precise and strong electric field. We resultantly measure the characteristic heat redistribution signature of such non-chemically reactive gases, and it’s promising capacity to evaporatively cool to ultralow temperatures.*

* [R. R. W. Wang, A. G. Sykes, and J. L. Bohn, **"Linear response of a periodically driven thermal dipolar gas"**, Physical Review A (2020).](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.102.033336) <br />
**DIGEST:**
*Cooling gases to ultra low temperatures allows in inter-atom collisions that leave the internal state of atoms unchanged. In this work, we study such a gas where the atoms are additionally highly magnetic. When periodically pumped, the gas heats up but at different rates in different directions, depending on the enforced orientation of the magnets. This work studies and characterizes the directionality of heat propagation through such magnetic atomic gases.*

* [R. R. W. Wang, B. Xing, G. G. Carlo, and D. Poletti, **"Period doubling in period-one steady states"**, Physical Review E (2018).](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.97.020202) <br />
**DIGEST:**
*Much like ordinary crystals that have an orderly structure in space, time crystals are unique phases where matter develops order also in time. In this work, we show the emergence of time crystal signatures known as period doubling, with a quantum system of many particles known as Bosons. These Bosons are pumped with energy in cycles, while also dissipating energy to their environment so that the result is a long-lived, robust state of time crystalline order.*
