I was born and raised in the tropical island of [Singapore](https://www.visitsingapore.com/en/). Having had a keen curiosity of the world around me, this led to a deep appreciation of music, art and the natural sciences. The last of which eventually spurred me to pursue a formal education in STEM, where I studied engineering (at [SUTD](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/)) and physics (at [MIT](http://www.mit.edu/)) as an undergraduate. Over the course of my educational life, physics has grown to be a true passion of mine. Physics presents an opportunity for us to resolve some of the greatest mysteries of our universe, and takes us down the infinite rabbit hole to understanding our reality. This brings me to where I am now, pursing a PhD in theoretical physics at [CU, Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/). 


# PHYSICS RESEARCH

I am currently working in the [Bohn group](http://grizzly.colorado.edu/) at [JILA](https://jila.colorado.edu/). My area of research falls under the field of *atomic, molecular and optical* (**AMO**) physics, particularly studying many-body physics and thermodynamics of ultracold gases (i.e. I like to study the behavior of systems with many things when they are very cold). Below is a (hopefully growing) list of my publications. Enjoy!
