I was born and raised in the tropical island of [Singapore](https://www.visitsingapore.com/en/). My formal academic pursuits have been in STEM, where I studied engineering (at [SUTD](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/)) and physics (at [MIT](http://www.mit.edu/)) as an undergraduate. I am now doing my doctorate in theoretical physics at [JILA](https://jila.colorado.edu/), a joint institute between [CU, Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/) and [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/). [Here's](./whyPhD.md) a little write up of why a PhD for those interested. 

# Physics Research

I am currently working in the [Bohn group](http://grizzly.colorado.edu/) at [JILA](https://jila.colorado.edu/). My area of research falls under the field of *atomic, molecular and optical* (**AMO**) physics, particularly studying *many-body physics* and the *thermodynamics of ultracold gases* (i.e. I like to study the behavior of systems with many things when they are very cold). Below is a (hopefully growing) list of my publications. Enjoy! 

## Publications

*Just as the temperature of a room eventually evenly raises with the sudden introduction of heat, so too is the same for an isolated gas of atoms. The route to this new equilibrium temperature, is however highly dependent on the properties of the gas’ constituent atoms. In this work, we derive tractable formulas for how the magnetism of atoms in a gas can affect its route to temperature equilibrium. These formulas will thus allow experimentalist to determine magnetic properties in atoms, simply by temperature measurements alone. *
