# Autonomous Pick-and-Place Robot

Over the course of about 9 months, a team of friends and I embarked on building an AI-robotic system that could perform general 
pick-and-place tasks. The final system was the integration of a 6-axis robotic arm from [Universal Robots](https://www.universal-robots.com/),
a vision system consisting of digital and depth cameras, and an AI program that ran on an external processor. Our system was able to:

* identify and categorize objects when placed on a pre-defined palette;
* ascertain the optimal picking confguration and trajectory to move the object into a pre-defined bin.
